Tudor Wars
==========

By Beau Lewis.

The aim of the game
-------------------

to get your character, either King Henry viii or Francis Drake to the
right of the screen without losing all of your lives. You can lose a
life by getting hit by a cannonball or a lance (spear) or touching the
french cavalry or the spanish ships advancing to the left. If they make
it to the left, it is game over. You have to shoot the ships or horses
to get past them.

scoring and lives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your lives are green hearts in the top left-hand corner. if you lose a
life, it turns into a red broken heart. The level you are on is next to
them. Your score is right above your lives. you get ten points when you
hit a cannonball or a lance (spear). You get 1 if you hit a ship or
horse. The ships and horses have 6 lives. You get 100 if you hit the
enemy commander. hint: it is easier to get through if you destroy the
ships or horses.
