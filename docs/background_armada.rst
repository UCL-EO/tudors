The Spanish Armada
==================

The Spanish Armada was a fleet of 130 ships that were sent to invade
England in late may 1588 by king Philip the second. This resulted in a
battle from May until August 1588. Francis drake was playing a game of
bowls when the Spanish invaded and waited until he was finished to
attack back. England had 34 warships and 163 armed merchant vessels
whereas the Spanish had 108 armed merchant vessels, 2,431 cannons, 7,000
sailors and 17,000 soldiers.(the English also had 30 flyboats as they
had teamed up with the Dutches. This eventually ended in an English
victory.
