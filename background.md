# Tudor Wars

By Beau Lewis

# Background

The tudor monarchs were Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Lady Jane grey, Mary I and Elizabeth I. During this era, the tudors had many wars and battles. This game features two notable battles, against the french and the spanish. the setup of the game is based loosely on space invaders. The battles in this game are called the battle of the spurs and the spanish armada.(the second one doesn't actually have a name.) Interestingly, the spanish flag is drastically different to the modern day flag. This is because the old one was for the spanish empire, whereas the modern one is just for spain.
